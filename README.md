## üìö Required Libraries (LIBRARIES)

To run the application, install the following packages:

```bash
pip install pyqt5 pyqtwebengine geopy folium requests serpapi
````

**List of Libraries:**

  * `pyqt5`
  * `pyqtwebengine`
  * `geopy`
  * `folium`
  * `requests`
  * `serpapi`

## üöÄ Setup and Launch Requirements

To ensure the program runs correctly and displays all features, the following steps are necessary:

### 1\. Obtain and Set Up API Keys

I need to insert my personal keys directly into the corresponding variables in the code:

  * **OpenWeatherMap Key:** I must insert this into the `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` variable so the application can fetch weather data.
  * **SerpAPI Key:** I must insert this into the `SERPAPI_KEY` variable so my AI Assistant can perform real-time Google searches.

*(**Important:** Without these keys, I will not see the current weather or be able to use the AI assistant features).*

### 2\. Create the Backgrounds Folder

I need to create a folder named `backgrounds` in the same directory as my Python file and place images inside it for the dynamic background:

  * `clear*.jpg` (for clear weather)
  * `clouds*.jpg` (for cloudy weather)
  * `rain*.jpg` (for rain)
  * `storm*.jpg` (for storms)
  * `snow*.jpg` (for snow)

*(This is necessary for the application to have a beautiful, dynamically changing background).*

### 3\. Ensure Internet Connection

I must make sure my computer has an active Internet connection, as the program constantly interacts with various external services (weather, geocoding, translation, and search APIs).

```
